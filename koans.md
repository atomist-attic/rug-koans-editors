# Welcome to the Atomist Rug Koans!

Welcome to the Rug Koans learning journey! If you want to learn to write code that generates and evolves code, you're in the right place.

The Koans walk you along the path to learning the Rug language and Atomist ecosystem that surrounds it. The goal is to learn the Rug language syntax, structure, and explore some of the types and reusable rugs that are out there.

At each step in the journey you will:

- `Start` to edit an existing project to add the artifacts you'll need to then work with, including the instructions to actually complete those steps.

- `See Solution` to check that your code matches the solution that we suggest.

- `Apply Solution` to apply the solution to the editable files you've been working on if you get *really* stuck.

## Before you Start...

Before you start the journey please make sure you've got a project repository set up either on GitHub or in a directory locally. The easiest way of making sure you have everything set is to generate a new project using the [Rug Koans Project generator](https://github.com/atomist-rugs/rug-koans-project) (if you've already done that and are actually here because that generator's generated project's README brought you here, then you're all set.).

With your project in hand the other thing you'll need is the [Rug CLI][rug-cli], so make sure you've [installed that][rug-cli] as well.

## Now select your preferred way of working through these Koans

The are currently two main ways of working through and executing the Rug Koans. You can:

- [Start your Journey with Buttons on a project in GitHub](koansbuttonsintro.md) - Click through the buttons to work on an existing project in your own GitHub account.

- [Start your Journey locally outside of GitHub with the Rug CLI](koanscliintro.md) - Grab this repository and use the [Rug CLI][rug-cli] to apply the editors here to do the same thing on a local project repository outside of GitHub.

- Start your Journey using the Atomist Bot (coming _very_ soon)
