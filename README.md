# Atomist 'rug-koans-editors'

A set of editors for getting to grips with [Rug][rug].

[rug]: http://docs.atomist.com/

## Usage

First run the [Rug Koans Project generator](https://github.com/atomist-rugs/rug-koans-project) and that will then lead you on the journey of executing these editors against your project as you explore the features of Rug.

## Rugs

If you like you can run the Rugs here outside of the Koans journey that begins with the [Rug Koans project generator](https://github.com/atomist-rugs/rug-koans-project). Here we describe each of the individual Rugs and what they will attempt to do.

### Step1

The Step1 editor creates the files that are the starting point for the first step on the Rug Koans journey.

#### Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites to running this generator, although it is advised that ideally you should be working on the project generated by the [Rug Koans project generator](https://github.com/atomist-rugs/rug-koans-project).

#### Parameters

No parameters are required.

#### Running

Run this Rug editor as follows:

```
$ cd targetproject
$ rug edit atomist-rugs:rug-koans-editors:Step1
```

## Development

You can build, test, and install the project locally with
the [Rug CLI][cli].

[cli]: https://github.com/atomist/rug-cli

```
$ rug test
$ rug install
```

To create a new release of the project, simply push a tag of the form
`M.N.P` where `M`, `N`, and `P` are integers that form the next
appropriate [semantic version][semver] for release.  For example:

[semver]: http://semver.org

```
$ git tag -a 1.2.3
```

The Travis CI build (see badge at the top of this page) will
automatically create a GitHub release using the tag name for the
release and the comment provided on the annotated tag as the contents
of the release notes.  It will also automatically upload the needed
artifacts.
